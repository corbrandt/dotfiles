# 🛠️ My Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This is where I store my personal configuration files to set up my system environment quickly and efficiently across different machines. Feel free to explore, fork, and customize them to fit your workflow.

## 📂 What's Inside?

This repository contains:

- **Shell Configurations**
  - `.bashrc` – Customized shell environment settings
  - Aliases, functions, and custom scripts
- **Newsboat**
  - Custom theme and layout
- Config for mpv.

## 🚀 Installation

To install these dotfiles, you can use the following steps:
